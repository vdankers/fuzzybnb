The myth was that there were coins burried in the woods here: will you be able to find this treasure?

The house is a typical Dutch âDijk Houseâ with three levels. On the dike level are the main entrance and the living kitchen.  Below dike level is living room and on the first floor are the bedrooms.  There is a private garden with a terrace on the water behind the house. Directly across the street lays a stretched out lawn/playground where you'll find our own picnic table with great views on Amsterdam IJ, horses and ships sailing by. It's a lovely place to be when you come home after a day in the city.  The house has 2 bedrooms and a 2 person sleeping couch in the living room. Two bathrooms are at your disposal, one next to",none,"In a 5-minute bike ride you get to meadows or to the ancient villages Durgerdam, Holysloot, and Ransdorp, while Broek in Waterland, Marken and Volendam are close by car. A beautiful start to explore Amsterdam North is the EYE movie centre, which is located near the ferry and gives you a wonderful view at the IJ river and Amsterdam. And at the banks at the North side of the IJ (ten minutes ride) you will find previously disused warehouses which host creative start-ups, festivals, restaurants and, once a month, mega flea market.  ","The house is near the IJsselmeer lake where you can swim and sail in summer. The area is perfect for bike trips, running and walking. All necessary shops are nearby, about 7 minutes walk is the local indoor farmer market, Landmarkt. ","Itâs only a 20-30 min bike ride to the centre of Amsterdam (including a ferry ride to the central station).  From Schiphol Airport it takes 30 to 45 minutes with public transport (train, bus).  Bus 32 takes you from the central station in 10-15 minutes to our house (+5-10 minutes walk).  The A10 motorway (no noise) is nearby, exit S115 and then 3 minutes to go.","The entire (three floor) house of about 100m2 is at the guest's disposal (except the extension in which private stuff will be stored). The access to the house is by the main entrance on the street.  You can park your car for free in front of the house and bicycles (2 adult, 2 children and 1 'bakfiets') are available.  ","We won't be there during your stay. In some cases we might be there at you arrival and departure. Sometimes someone else will be present. You can always reach us by phone in case of emergencies, questions etc. ","We live in a neighborhood with a countryside feeling. The house is very suitable for families with children or friends that are looking for a calm and relaxing place near the citycenter.  No loud noise, no smoking and no pets.",,,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/62263154/92fb531f_original.jpg?aki_policy=large,,21077937,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/21077937,Hanneke,2014-09-08,"Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands",,within a day,100%,100%,f,https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/21077937/profile_pic/1420470528/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/21077937/profile_pic/1420470528/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Landelijk Noord,1.0,1.0,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"Schellingwouderdijk, Amsterdam, Noord-Holland 1023 NB, Netherlands",Landelijk Noord,Noord-Oost,,Amsterdam,Noord-Holland,1023 NB,Amsterdam,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",NL,Netherlands,52.38606915680533,4.957696521637744,t,House,Entire home/apt,5,2.0,2.0,3.0,Real Bed,"{""Wireless Internet"",Kitchen,""Free Parking on Premises"",""Indoor Fireplace"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,""Smoke Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",Essentials,Shampoo}",,$150.00,$902.00,,,$40.00,1,$0.00,6,30,a week ago,,18,44,71,346,2016-07-04,1,2016-04-30,2016-04-30,100.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,f,,Amsterdam,f,strict,f,f,1,0.45

WORK: Interior design projectmanager 

ABOUT ME: Hi, I'm your host, Mirjam. As a guest I started to use airbnb about two years ago in 2013. It was such a good experience for me that I decided to start renting my own apartment at airbnb beacuse i'm travelling on a regular basis for my job.   
I offer a modern cosy apartment near the centre of Amsterdam. A relative new and upcoming part of town at the IJ river, near a park, station, fast 10 minute connection to the city with many bus- and tram options. I live in a nice, modern building. In daily life I work as a manager on interior design projects. I like to work with creative people and the artists of craftsmanship. As I lived many years in the city now, I like to share the nice spots (not only touristic!) in Amsterdam. We have a rich history, beautiful canals (have a boattrip!) with the characteristic houses from the 17th century. But also many modern and special shops like in the 9 Streets, the area which the city of Amsterdam is built on. Many restaurants and cafÃ¨s... Musea, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, the Anne Frank House. The new Eye filmmuseum. So much to see & things to experience!

What I also really enjoy is that my gardenhouse is a short distance from my house . The rooting with hands in the earth, grow and bloom of flowers and plants I love it. I like to eat healthy but with a focus on animal welfare and the preservation of our planet so that my nieces and nephews can still have a future.

Just make sure he doesn't go outside trough the front door, the balcony in the other hand is his domain to play (and chase pigeons whenever he can).","At the shopping mall there's a bus stop where every 15 to 20 minutes busses leave to central station (20 minutes), Sloterdijk station (15 minutes, ideal for travelers arriving and departing for Schiphol airport, which is only another 10 minutes by train), and Amstel station (about 35, 40 minutes). You can also choose to cycle of course. To get to central station, it's only a 7, 8 minutes cycling to NDSM from where the free ferry leaves every 30 minutes to central station in about 12 minutes.

Together with my husband Jang, I love to receive guests and sharing all that makes our spot such a wonderful place to live in. I love the colours in and around our house.

I teach music to very young children (I used to be a kindergarten teacher) and was able to turn my music hobby into my profession. I love classical pieces, but also folk and world music. We love visiting small music festivals, especially in summer.

When I stop moving around and take the time to sit down and read, I usually pick up a psychological novel. We try to minimize watching TV, but if we do watch it, we choose travel and housefinding programmes. Going to a movie with a friend is another one of my regular treats.

We eat food from various foreign cultures, such as Turkish, Indonesian, Mexican, Libanese, Thai, etc. Of course we also love to travel, together or on our own. Portugal, Czech Republic, France, Norway, Turkey, America, Aruba, Lebanon, Syria, South-Africa. These are some of the countries we have visited. Ik like camping as well as staying in a bed and breakfast. A hotel is fine for a couple of nights, but not my favourite stay on a holiday trip. I like to travel by train or bicycle.

My house is not near the city center but you can take a bus that will bring you right to the heart of the city in less then 20 minutes.,"What people like about my house is the fact that it feels like home. There is an easy going atmosphere and you feel welcome as soon as you arrive.  There are 2 cats and a small dog in the house! People that love pets will be delighted but if you are not a pet friend you might want to choose another listing :-) My pets are very sweet and won't bother you at all.  The fact that the house is not on walking distance to the city center is for some people a point to dislike the location although it's really easy and a short bus ride to get into the heart of the city. If you are intending to spend a lot of time in the room, please note that the room is not very big and if you are with more then 2 persons that could be a bit tight. Also if you are a group of big people ;-) you might find the room too small for you.","My house is on the North side of Amsterdam, just 5 minutes from the trendy NDSM warf where you will find amazing spots to eat and chill-out and less then 20 minutes with the bus to the city center.  The bus is only 5 minutes walk from my house.  There is a small shopping center 10 minutes walk through the park and a supermarket even more close by where you can get some snacks or drinks.  Parking is free in my neighborhood. You can park your car just around the corner.",Guests are welcome to sit in the living room during breakfast and to use the garden anytime they like. Smoking is allowed in the garden.,At check-in I will give you as much information as I can to help you around and let you prepare for a good time in Amsterdam. Mostly I am around to help you with anything during your stay. At breakfast is a good time to drop your questions and tell about your experiences. If you prefer to have breakfast quietly in your room that is also possible :-),Please make sure you read the full description of my listing and feel free to ask me anything you need to know.

It's is one of the so called 'garden villages' that was developed around 1919 between the First and Second World War as a counterbalance to the impoverished neighborhoods in the city. Another reason for the neighborhood of Tuindorp Oostzaan to arise was the need of housing of the growing group of workers from the new industry and shipyards on the north banks of the IJ. Nowadays the district has more than 10,000 inhabitants. Relatively speaking, there are many elderly people and families with children compared to all of Amsterdam-Noord. Single family homes are in the majority. The old, low-lying part of Tuindorp Oostzaan is mostly built in the twenties. The upper part is built in different periods of time and contains more modern houses, lofts, apartments and villas.

My husband - Frans - and I have been living in Amsterdam for more than 8 years now. For us it's the most wonderful city to live in!

I'm 29 and Belgian, Frans is 35 and a Dutchman. Together we've done quite some traveling. We met in Mallorca, lived together in Ghent, Belgium for 3 years, lived in Istanbul, Turkey for 1/2 year, extensively travelled through Italy & Spain and in 2013 we came back from a 1 year trip around South-America. Though having seen all these beautiful places, Amsterdam has stolen our hearts and we can't imagine living anywhere else but here. Cycling through the city, across the bridges and next to the canals always puts a very large smile on our faces!

Just finished one business in childrenclothing. Looking out for new ideas to do. In the meanwhile I wonna meet people from all over the world. 
A friend telling me about Airbnb inspired me to also become a host. 

Things I can't do without for instance are my daughter, music, a dailly laughter or smile, my health and socks....
I've traveled to a few places like England. France, Germany  several times, Los Angeles once and my favorite trip was to Jamaica. That was really adventurous cause I went on a 3 weeks journey but only booked a bungalow for 3 days and I had faith that I would meet people who would took me in and so happened. 
My favorite book is Segou, written by Marisa Condee. To me that was not just a story but a script to a movie. A story that pulled me in everytime I would start to read. Like I was right in the middle of what I was reading. 
My Favorite movie is a classic one, from the 1960's and it's called Imitations of live. A story about mental conditions and positions as result of colorlines and racism. 
HipHop, R&B (especiallyl golden oldies) Soul and Reggae are my favorite kinds of music. But actually I don't mind listening to lots of kinds of music.
When it comes to food, I must say I'm from the caribean (Suriname) so I like caribean food a lot. It's sort of a variety of african, native american, Indian, indonesian, chinese, dutch dishes and mixtures of it. 
But over here in Amsterdam you get to meet with a lot of food of other cultures, fot instance japanese, turkish and italian
 
I actually live in walkingdistance from Amsterdam Central Station/Center. There are a few bars(pubs), restaurants and supermarkets. 
3 days a week there's a market around the corner. Also let me mention, there are a few coffeeshops in the erea for those who like to smoke marihuana. So there's no need to go all the way to town for that. 
The EYE-Museum is also in the neighborhood. Around that area is enough action, daytime as well as at night.

I just registered myself as host so I'm about to get my first experience. I'm used to having friends and family over for weekends or sometimes even during weekdays. I always try to make sure my place is somewhere people like to come over and feel welcome to stay. Make them feel at home or at least, make them feel save while they're away from home. 

I live in a nice little quiet street where you can hear people talking when they pass in the evening or at night. 
It's on the first floor so there's not much stairs to cllimb. Only for the shower wich is on the second floor. I'm not used to playing loud music. That kind of developed because I have two families with young children on opposite sides of me. 

My lifes motto is ""Live and let live"". The universe has enough to provide for everyone.

- in the winter we lay down in a cosy harbor in the middle of the historcal maritime area, with typical Dutch architecture as warehouses, wooden bridges and old houseboats. A true pearl in the city centre of Amsterdam!

- in the summer we lay down in a small romantic harbor in the North of Amsterdam, perfect to swim and walk at the green fields near the IJ-waters.

The neighborhood is residential, but lively and urban with grocery shops and many different inhabitants reflecting the city's charm. There's a little playground in front of the house, making it perfect for kids. There are some amazing restaurants around, ranging from cheap ones nearby, to higher prized but extremely good restaurants in industrial area's around. More and more alternative spaces and communities are opening up in the Noord. The cinema and film museum EYE is very near.

You get to our apartment by taking a ferry directly behind the Central Station, which takes you across the water (for free!) in 5 min, offering a beautiful view. From there it's a 5 min walk to our place. The ferry nearest to our place goes until midnight, after that you can take another ferry, which crosses regularly 24/7. From that ferry it's just a 10 min walk to our place.  Central Station is the central point for all public transport in Amsterdam, which will make it easy for you to move around the city from there. You can also easily walk into the centre from the station, or bike of course! Our place is very accessible by car and there's lots of (free) parking space around. We advise you not to take the car into the city centre. It's full and parking is expensive there.","We offer you our apartment as we like to enjoy it ourselves and hope you will feel at home!

Friends and family are living down the road, so there's always someone around to give a helping hand when necessary. We will love to give you tips and routes to special places.

In the late seventies I was born on the Frisian island Ameland. After growing up in Harlingen and studying tourism in Groningen, I moved over to the one place that stole my heart: Amsterdam.

Since 2011 I live together with my beautiful and creative girlfriend Cynthia in the cosy and beloved family home that you are about to rent. Cynthia and I both love to travel (mainly backpacking, scuba diving/snorkelling) and instead of asking our neighbours to water the plants while we're away, we recently decided to join the Airbnb network.

Where Cynthia loves to draw and paint, I personally never get tired from cycling, skating, walking, running or kayaking through the city and its surroundings. We are both big fans of the Amsterdam cultural activities and nightlife. Together with our friends we often check in at the local bars, restaurants, clubs, museums, theatres, concerts, festivals and techno parties. 

Cynthia and I place people above material things, nevertheless our house is decorated with quite a lot of books, drawings, memories, photo's and  souvenirs from our adventures and travels. Most stuff meaningless to others, but priceless to us.

We are looking forward to welcome relaxed and responsible guests in our residence. So feel free to request, and we will get back to you as soon as possible...

We as a family live in Amsterdam with a lot of fun, pleasure and gratitude. We want to welcome you to this beautiful an open minded place.

Besides work and hobbies: inspiration, vocation, work, career and self-confidence, we as a family like it very much to open our doors to guests from around the world, to exercise our languages ââand exchange tips.

In our spare time we enjoy running and walking outside and watching good movies curled up together on the sofa and enjoy each others company. We love reading before going to bed, on a sunday-afternoon or in bed. 

We love the sound of Chopin but also westernized indian music from Deva Premal. We enjoy eating out, organic food, recipe's from the oven, warm quiches, pies but also fish, lots of fish and vegetables.

We love to travel and want to see so many countries and places: an elephant trek in India, a jungle tour and diving in Thailand, on a camel through the Sahara and in a jeep from South to North Africa, but we also enjoy sightseeing and shopping in San Fransico, Florence, Naples and Venice. There is so much to see and discover ..

In Amsterdam, our doors are open for you.

Hallo,

Wij als gezin wonen in Amsterdam met veel plezier en dankbaarheid. Wij heten je van harte welkom om deze prachtige een open minded plek te zien en ervaren.

Naast werk en hobby's: inspiratie, roeping, werk, carriÃ¨re en zelfvertrouwen, genieten we als een gezin van het openstellen van onze deuren open voor gasten uit de hele wereld, om onze talen te oefenen en tips uit te wisselen.

In onze vrije tijd genieten we van hardlopen en wandelen en kijken we opgerold op de bank naar goede films genietend van elkaars gezelschap. We houden van lezen en voorlezen voor het slapen gaan, of lezen op een zondag-middag als de kinderen lekker in de kamer spelen.

We houden van het geluid van Chopin, maar ook verwesterde Indiase muziek zoals die van Deva Premal. We houden van yoga, stilte, meditatie. We genieten van uit eten gaan, biologisch voedsel, recept komt uit de oven, warme quiches, taarten, maar ook vis, veel vis en groenten. Maar het meest genieten we van grappen en de humor tussen ons.

Wij houden van reizen en willen nog heel veel landen en plaatsen zien en ervaren: een olifant trektocht in India, een jungle tour en duiken in Thailand, op een kameel door de Sahara en in een jeep van Zuid naar Noord-Afrika, maar we ook genieten van bezienswaardigheden en winkelen in San Fransico, Florence, Napels en VenetiÃ«.

Aan boord van de âCatharina van Mijdrechtâ bent u in de handen van een vakkundige en ervaren bemanning. Met hun jarenlange ervaring weten zij elke zeiltocht tot een onvergetelijke ervaring te maken. Jos Rodewijk is de schipper die jullie veilig over de woelige baren voert. Danny Honig is de gastvrouw en zorgt er voor dat het jullie op culinair gebied aan niets ontbreekt. Bij gelegenheid wordt het team uitgebreid met ervaren freelancers, bijvoorbeeld voor uw trainingen.

Passie voor water
U bent in handen van een ervaren bemanningGeboren en getogen in het Zuid-Hollands plassengebied leerde ik als snel omgaan met het water. Op mijn twaalfde zeilde ik al zelfstandig. Toen ik later van deze passie voor water mijn beroep kon maken greep ik die kans met beide handen aan.
Op mijn schip draait het om de beleving van mijn gasten. Of ze nu een paar uurtjes of meerdere dagen aan boord zijn, mijn streven is om ze een belevenis mee te geven waar ze het nog lang over zullen hebben. Jong of oud, gepassioneerd zeiler of passieve genieter, iedereen voelt zich thuis op de Catharina van Mijdrecht.
Jos Rodewijk, schipper.

Passie voor lekker eten
Ervaren bemanningAls telg uit een bekend soepmakersgeslacht zat de passie voor  koken al in de genen. Met ouders die bovendien op de Holland-Amerika Lijn voeren combineer ik nu beide werelden door de catering te verzorgen aan boord van de Catharina van Mijdrecht. Het is altijd een weer een uitdaging om onder de soms lastige omstandigheden aan boord toch een lekkere maaltijd op tafel te zetten. Met veel creativiteit en passie probeer ik regelmatig nieuwe gerechten uit. Ik ben pas tevreden als mijn gasten het zijn.

I'm Marleen, 37 years. I live with my husband and three children at the age of 2, 4 and 6 years in Amsterdam. Kasper (my husband) and I both work and therefore we love to go on trips ourselves when we have the time. Hiking, skiing and relaxing in a different environment. 

Last year we have traveled around Europe for three months. That was the first time we rented out our house. That time we used an agent. Now we rent our home directly which makes it more fun since you have direct contact with the tenants. Now we learn about why they wnat to visit Amsterdam and are happy to help them with tips for good restaurants, fun activities in and around the city. 

Our house is wonderfully light, spacious and fully equipped. Also an ideal place for children to play and a garden where you can enjoy a good glass of wine in the sun after a day of sight seeing Amsterdam. 

Hope to see you,

Paulâs a management consultant and I work as a coach for âpatchwork familiesâ. Weâre both self employed and our house is our home Ã¡nd our office. Weâre socially engaged and play an active part in all kinds of stuff going on in our community. We just love meeting people and helping out where we can. 
We usually get up earlier to walk our dog in the park or to dive into our busy daily work routines. When Iâm not working I love going into town with friends, or meeting up with my grown up children who live in the city centre. I also enjoying redecorating our house â a lovely pastime that for me, is a piece of work thatâs permanetly âin progressâ! 

Weâre keen users of AirBnB facilities ourselves and now that our children have moved out, its time for us to repay the hospitality others have shown us in the past. We set our standards by looking at what we expect ourselves. We enjoy helping you feel at home and adding a personal touch to your visit, but only when a little bit of help is asked for. We like to give you as much room as possible to discover Amsterdam and its surroundings in your own pace and at your own discretion.

We believe in a sustainable economy and enjoy meeting people through acts of sharing what we have with others.

How is it going today? Allow me to have a few seconds of your time to tell you a few things about myself. My name is Guilherme de Almeida. I am 28 years young. Personally I like to perceive myself as a global citizen. This is because Iâve been traveling and living in different places ever since I can remember. 

I am a person that is always open to new ideas, experience and people. I am a very curious and ambitious person who is committed to excellence.  Iâve a broad field of interest and my flexibility has allowed me to meet and learn from people from all walks of life.

In my spare time I like to practice sports, explore new grounds, meet interesting people and expand my knowledge on almost any subject. You can always wake me up to talk about your passion. 

As your guest I'll probably be the invisible ghost. Waking up at sunrise and returning only after sunset.  There is so much to experience and so little time. Donât you think? 

As your host I'll make sure to give you the best hospitality as I possibly can. You having a great experience is  my number one goal. I take pride in assisting you with anything you need. I like to stand for integrity and quality.  Personally I feel  that when you are traveling you should feel just as comfortable as you feel at your own home. Believe me you wonât be sorry to spend time at our place. So, do you feel like having a pleasant time? Get in touch today and make it happen!

It consists of several islands connected by bridges, has a harbor and the city's only real beach. The water reflects in the air and the light is therefore brighter than in the rest of Amsterdam. The wind blows stronger than in the rest of Amsterdam, like a sea breeze. The wind blows away the clouds and the sun seems to shine more often. IJburg feels like a holiday island all year.  The first house at IJburg was build in 2002. By now, the islands have 15.000 dwellers and are still growing. The main islands are Steigereiland (pier island), Rieteiland and Haveneiland (harbor island).  IJburg is already discovered by many tourists who love the combination of modern architecture, water, nature, good restaurants and hip shops. IJburg has much to offer for architecture lovers. Barcelona even got inspired by IJburg when it designed its own enlargement El Prat Nord.  There are lots of playgrounds for the kids and of course Blijburg beach and its beach club.

I love traveling. Have in the past traveled extensively in Asia. Since the arrival of our children we do not travel with a backpack, but we often make a trip with our Volkswagen camper van. In addition, we regularly go to Spain or Italy for a week to feel the sun.
I also like to read a good book in the hammock in our lovely garden. Or I drink coffee or a glass of wine with friends on a terrace in the park or in the playground.
I work as a teacher. The students keep me young and free-thinking.

We live in a lovely neighbourhood on IJburg, close to the city, but also close to a beach, lake and big park. Amsterdam is not only open-minded and laid-back, but also has much to offer on a cultural and artistic area. We would like to give you the chance to discover this lovely city and relax back in our quiet house  & garden.

Welcome to Amsterdam!
Our property is in principle available every weekend, from saturday till Monday. It is also possible to rent the property during school holidays (check the calendar for the exact dates) which I try to keep up-to-date.

Over mezelf:
Ik hou van reizen. Heb in het verleden veel gereisd in AziÃ«. Sinds de komst van onze kinderen reizen we niet meer met een rugzak, maar gaan we er vaak tussenuit met ons Volkswagen camperbusje. Daarnaast gaan we regelmatig een weekje naar Spanje of ItaliÃ« om de zon te voelen.
Daarnaast lees ik graag een goed boek in de hangmat in onze heerlijke tuin. Of ik drink koffie of een goed glas wijn met vriendinnen op een terras, in het park of in de speeltuin.
Ik werk als docent. De leerlingen houden me jong en vrij denkend.

Wij wonen in een heerlijke, ruime woning op IJburg in Amsterdam. Amsterdam is niet alleen ruimdenkend en laid-back, maar heeft ook veel te bieden op cultureel en kunstzinnig gebied. Wij willen je graag de kans geven om vanuit ons relaxte huis deze heerlijke stad te ontdekken.

The table by the window seats five (one high chair for children age 3-12).  There's a small sofa and comfortable chair but no tv downstairs. Also downstairs is the storage area with the washingmachine and dryer. On the first floor are our three daugthers' bedrooms. Two bedrooms with each a high sleeper and the third bedroom is very small with a single bed (all 3 beds are 90x200). The toilet and bathroom are separate. There's a bath, a shower over the bath, and a washbasin. Towels, a hairdryer, and ha",none,Our house is situated at the quiet end of IJburg. There's hardly any traffic in front of the house and we use the pavement as our front garden. IJburg is a new area with lots of families and nice architecture (we get a lot of city planning students walking around the island). There is a beach at the IJsselmeer side of the island and a small beach in the Diemerpark. There's even a special surf beach with a surfschool. Lots of people sup around these waters. And of course canoeing is another option.,"Our house is clean and cosy, but no showroom. We live in our house and enjoy our furniture as do our three rowdy girls, so here and there it might show. We also welcome people to enjoy the house in full so whatever is here you can use. So, books, toys, bikes, sandbox, umbrellas, etc, are all here to use. We just ask that you use it in a loving way, as we try to do.","Tramline 26 takes you right into the heart of the city in about 10 to 15 minutes. By car it's only minutes to get to the eastside or the centre, for instance the zoo, or several daily markets. But beware parking is expensive. By bike it's about a 20 minute ride to the eastside which is a nice area with lots of reastaurants, shops, markets, parks, and museums. To the centre it's about a 30 minute ride. Walking would take about an hour (but it would be a nice walk through a park and along the Amsterdam-Rhine canal before you reach the eastside)  ","The whole house is at your disposal, we won't lock any rooms. Also what's in and around the house is free for use. There's a bike (see photo), children's bikes and toys, lots of books, and a hairdryer.  Free (!) parking at the rear enclosed safe parking area (in the courtyard).","During rental periods we will be on holiday ourselves but we'll always be available for contact by phone, email, or app. My mother will also be here in Amsterdam (she lives in the city centre) and will be there for key exchange and will also be available for questions. She has lived in Amsterdam all her life, has worked with tourists, speaks English, Portugese, French, and German and knows the good places.",We only accept bookings of guests who have ID-verification. Since some of us are very allergic to certain animals and are also asthmatic there can be absolutely no pets. And no smoking or drugs of any kind!  We like to take off our shoes once inside (Amsterdam is not the cleanest city with regards to dogs although our area is fine) but this is up to you.,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/105500044/7ff4c18d_original.jpg?aki_policy=small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/105500044/7ff4c18d_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/105500044/7ff4c18d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/105500044/7ff4c18d_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large,29145151,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/29145151,Chiara,2015-03-11,"Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands","We are a married couple with 3 daughters: Lottie (3), Tess (6), and Ella (9).
