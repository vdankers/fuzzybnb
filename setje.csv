The myth was that there were coins burried in the woods here: will you be able to find this treasure? In winter, if the ice is thick enough to skate on, the inhabitants of Amsterdam use our neighbourhood as their startingpoint for endless iceskating tours.

The house is a typical Dutch ‘Dijk House’ with three levels. On the dike level are the main entrance and the living kitchen.  Below dike level is living room and on the first floor are the bedrooms.  There is a private garden with a terrace on the water behind the house. Directly across the street lays a stretched out lawn/playground where you'll find our own picnic table with great views on Amsterdam IJ, horses and ships sailing by. It's a lovely place to be when you come home after a day in the city.  The house has 2 bedrooms and a 2 person sleeping couch in the living room. Two bathrooms are at your disposal, one next to",none,"In a 5-minute bike ride you get to meadows or to the ancient villages Durgerdam, Holysloot, and Ransdorp, while Broek in Waterland, Marken and Volendam are close by car. A beautiful start to explore Amsterdam North is the EYE movie centre, which is located near the ferry and gives you a wonderful view at the IJ river and Amsterdam. And at the banks at the North side of the IJ (ten minutes ride) you will find previously disused warehouses which host creative start-ups, festivals, restaurants and, once a month, mega flea market.  ","The house is near the IJsselmeer lake where you can swim and sail in summer. The area is perfect for bike trips, running and walking. All necessary shops are nearby, about 7 minutes walk is the local indoor farmer market, Landmarkt. ","It’s only a 20-30 min bike ride to the centre of Amsterdam (including a ferry ride to the central station).  From Schiphol Airport it takes 30 to 45 minutes with public transport (train, bus).  Bus 32 takes you from the central station in 10-15 minutes to our house (+5-10 minutes walk).  The A10 motorway (no noise) is nearby, exit S115 and then 3 minutes to go.","The entire (three floor) house of about 100m2 is at the guest's disposal (except the extension in which private stuff will be stored). The access to the house is by the main entrance on the street.  You can park your car for free in front of the house and bicycles (2 adult, 2 children and 1 'bakfiets') are available.  ","We won't be there during your stay. In some cases we might be there at you arrival and departure. Sometimes someone else will be present. You can always reach us by phone in case of emergencies, questions etc. ","We live in a neighborhood with a countryside feeling. The house is very suitable for families with children or friends that are looking for a calm and relaxing place near the citycenter.

WORK: Interior design projectmanager 

ABOUT ME: Hi, I'm your host, Mirjam. As a guest I started to use airbnb about two years ago in 2013. It was such a good experience for me that I decided to start renting my own apartment at airbnb beacuse i'm travelling on a regular basis for my job.   
I offer a modern cosy apartment near the centre of Amsterdam. A relative new and upcoming part of town at the IJ river, near a park, station, fast 10 minute connection to the city with many bus- and tram options. I live in a nice, modern building. In daily life I work as a manager on interior design projects. I like to work with creative people and the artists of craftsmanship. As I lived many years in the city now, I like to share the nice spots (not only touristic!) in Amsterdam. We have a rich history, beautiful canals (have a boattrip!) with the characteristic houses from the 17th century. But also many modern and special shops like in the 9 Streets, the area which the city of Amsterdam is built on. Many restaurants and cafès... Musea, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, the Anne Frank House. The new Eye filmmuseum. So much to see & things to experience!

The entire apartment was renovated a few years ago, so all the sanitary facilities are top notch. With the balcony looking out over the park, you can literally see the seasons changing from green to brown and yellow. It's truly w remarkable process.

My personal favorite is the newly opened cafe at the Zonneplein called Lokaal Spaanders. Wanna have dinner? Why don't you try the restaurant nearby called Eten Aan De Dijk. There is enough to be explored! Go check it out!","I have a sweet little cat who needs to be fed every day. He will be thankful for it, trust me, you will know it. Just make sure he doesn't go outside trough the front door, the balcony in the other hand is his domain to play (and chase pigeons whenever he can).","At the shopping mall there's a bus stop where every 15 to 20 minutes busses leave to central station (20 minutes), Sloterdijk station (15 minutes, ideal for travelers arriving and departing for Schiphol airport, which is only another 10 minutes by train), and Amstel station (about 35, 40 minutes). You can also choose to cycle of course. To get to central station, it's only a 7, 8 minutes cycling to NDSM from where the free ferry leaves every 30 minutes to central station in about 12 minutes. There are also other ferries to other locations. Don't miss out on the experience of seeing Amsterdam from the decks of a ferry along the river IJ. The cruises, ships, but also beautiful architecture (with Eye museum being the biggest eye catcher) along the way are definitely worth the while.","You won't be sharing the apartment with anyone else, which means you have access to all the facilities that range from a clean and sanitary toilet and shower to a lovely kitchen. There is free internet connection, however, I don't have a television for multiple reasons. But it shouldn't be a problem to find the channels you're looking for online these days.","The interaction goes trough me of course, however at some occasions I might not be around so I will put you in contact with a family member or friend just in case there are unresolved issues, complications, or even questions (it wouldn't be the first time someone locked themselves outside)","I would appreciate if you considered the neighbours as I have a good understanding with them and would like to keep it that way. Besides that I would also prefer if you took your cigarets outside, onto the balcony and not allow the cat to go into the bedroom or out the front door.

It's is one of the so called 'garden villages' that was developed around 1919 between the First and Second World War as a counterbalance to the impoverished neighborhoods in the city.

My husband - Frans - and I have been living in Amsterdam for more than 8 years now. For us it's the most wonderful city to live in!

I'm 29 and Belgian, Frans is 35 and a Dutchman. Together we've done quite some traveling. We met in Mallorca, lived together in Ghent, Belgium for 3 years, lived in Istanbul, Turkey for 1/2 year, extensively travelled through Italy & Spain and in 2013 we came back from a 1 year trip around South-America. Though having seen all these beautiful places, Amsterdam has stolen our hearts and we can't imagine living anywhere else but here. Cycling through the city, across the bridges and next to the canals always puts a very large smile on our faces!

Just finished one business in childrenclothing. Looking out for new ideas to do. In the meanwhile I wonna meet people from all over the world. 
A friend telling me about Airbnb inspired me to also become a host. 

Things I can't do without for instance are my daughter, music, a dailly laughter or smile, my health and socks....
I've traveled to a few places like England. France, Germany  several times, Los Angeles once and my favorite trip was to Jamaica. That was really adventurous cause I went on a 3 weeks journey but only booked a bungalow for 3 days and I had faith that I would meet people who would took me in and so happened. 
My favorite book is Segou, written by Marisa Condee. To me that was not just a story but a script to a movie. A story that pulled me in everytime I would start to read. Like I was right in the middle of what I was reading. 
My Favorite movie is a classic one, from the 1960's and it's called Imitations of live. A story about mental conditions and positions as result of colorlines and racism. 
HipHop, R&B (especiallyl golden oldies) Soul and Reggae are my favorite kinds of music. But actually I don't mind listening to lots of kinds of music.
When it comes to food, I must say I'm from the caribean (Suriname) so I like caribean food a lot. It's sort of a variety of african, native american, Indian, indonesian, chinese, dutch dishes and mixtures of it. 
But over here in Amsterdam you get to meet with a lot of food of other cultures, fot instance japanese, turkish and italian
 
I actually live in walkingdistance from Amsterdam Central Station/Center. There are a few bars(pubs), restaurants and supermarkets. 
3 days a week there's a market around the corner. Also let me mention, there are a few coffeeshops in the erea for those who like to smoke marihuana. So there's no need to go all the way to town for that. 
The EYE-Museum is also in the neighborhood. Around that area is enough action, daytime as well as at night.

I just registered myself as host so I'm about to get my first experience. I'm used to having friends and family over for weekends or sometimes even during weekdays. I always try to make sure my place is somewhere people like to come over and feel welcome to stay. Make them feel at home or at least, make them feel save while they're away from home. 

I live in a nice little quiet street where you can hear people talking when they pass in the evening or at night. 
It's on the first floor so there's not much stairs to cllimb. Only for the shower wich is on the second floor. I'm not used to playing loud music. That kind of developed because I have two families with young children on opposite sides of me. 

My lifes motto is ""Live and let live"". The universe has enough to provide for everyone.

Here a good article in the Guardian with lots of tips! (URL HIDDEN) The neighbourhood is relaxed, green and very close to the IJ river, with a beautiful view over the city. The neighborhood is residential, but lively and urban with grocery shops and many different inhabitants reflecting the city's charm. There's a little playground in front of the house, making it perfect for kids. There are some amazing restaurants around, ranging from cheap ones nearby, to higher prized but extremely good restaurants in industrial area's around. More and more alternative spaces and communities are opening up in the Noord. The cinema and film museum EYE is very near. For bars, clubs and clothing shops it's still better to cross the water and go into the center, which is also not far.",We prefer families staying in our apartment. This is not a party apartment.,"The best way to get from the airport into the city is by train. It takes you to Central Station in 15min and is cheap. You get to our apartment by taking a ferry directly behind the Central Station, which takes you across the water (for free!) in 5 min, offering a beautiful view. From there it's a 5 min walk to our place. The ferry nearest to our place goes until midnight, after that you can take another ferry, which crosses regularly 24/7. From that ferry it's just a 10 min walk to our place.  Central Station is the central point for all public transport in Amsterdam, which will make it easy for you to move around the city from there. You can also easily walk into the centre from the station, or bike of course! Our place is very accessible by car and there's lots of (free) parking space around. We advise you not to take the car into the city centre. It's full and parking is expensive there.","We offer you our apartment as we like to enjoy it ourselves and hope you will feel at home! You will have access to all our utilities, Wifi and parking in the neighborhood. Our apartment is on the second floor, so you have to walk up two flights of quite steep stairs.","We rent out our apartment when we are away ourselves, so generally we don't get to see much of our guests. We do like to communicate well before and after your stay and give you lots of tips. We are always available by phone if something goes wrong. We have good contact with our neighbors. Friends and family are living down the road, so there's always someone around to give a helping hand when necessary. We will love to give you tips and routes to special places. It's for instance very easy to bike to some beautiful Dutch villages, windmills and fields just North of Amsterdam, but also to rough industrial areas where creatives are slowly settling.","We only take families or groups of friends over 27 as our guests, if you don't fall within this category (even if we trust you are great and respectful people) we cannot accept you, because of agreements with our neighbors.

Ik werk al 7 jaar in Amsterdam en na 4 jaar op en neer reizen van en naar Amsterdam besloot ik er toch maar een huis te kopen. Een flinke zoektocht want ik wilde graag een tuin. Die heb ik nu, zowel voor waar de zon overdag schijnt, als achter waar ik na mijn werk lekker in de tuin van het zonnetje kan genieten. Ik ben dus helemaal blij met mijn woning en met mijn besluit om in Amsterdam te gaan wonen.
Ik reis zelf graag zo veel mogelijk, zonvakanties en stedentrips. Zonde om mijn woning dan leeg te laten staan dus op aanraden van een vriendin biedt ik mijn woning vanaf nu aan via Airbnb.

Linda loves animals, plants and cheesecake, but she can't cook. Luckily Mingus can. Unfortunately he doesn't like animals and plants. However, we travel a lot for work so we're not home often. We would love to show you our place and look forward to welcome you.

In the late seventies I was born on the Frisian island Ameland. After growing up in Harlingen and studying tourism in Groningen, I moved over to the one place that stole my heart: Amsterdam.

Since 2011 I live together with my beautiful and creative girlfriend Cynthia in the cosy and beloved family home that you are about to rent. Cynthia and I both love to travel (mainly backpacking, scuba diving/snorkelling) and instead of asking our neighbours to water the plants while we're away, we recently decided to join the Airbnb network.

Where Cynthia loves to draw and paint, I personally never get tired from cycling, skating, walking, running or kayaking through the city and its surroundings. We are both big fans of the Amsterdam cultural activities and nightlife. Together with our friends we often check in at the local bars, restaurants, clubs, museums, theatres, concerts, festivals and techno parties. 

Cynthia and I place people above material things, nevertheless our house is decorated with quite a lot of books, drawings, memories, photo's and  souvenirs from our adventures and travels. Most stuff meaningless to others, but priceless to us.

We are looking forward to welcome relaxed and responsible guests in our residence. So feel free to request, and we will get back to you as soon as possible...

We as a family live in Amsterdam with a lot of fun, pleasure and gratitude. We want to welcome you to this beautiful an open minded place.

Besides work and hobbies: inspiration, vocation, work, career and self-confidence, we as a family like it very much to open our doors to guests from around the world, to exercise our languages ​​and exchange tips.

In our spare time we enjoy running and walking outside and watching good movies curled up together on the sofa and enjoy each others company. We love reading before going to bed, on a sunday-afternoon or in bed. 

We love the sound of Chopin but also westernized indian music from Deva Premal. We enjoy eating out, organic food, recipe's from the oven, warm quiches, pies but also fish, lots of fish and vegetables.

We love to travel and want to see so many countries and places: an elephant trek in India, a jungle tour and diving in Thailand, on a camel through the Sahara and in a jeep from South to North Africa, but we also enjoy sightseeing and shopping in San Fransico, Florence, Naples and Venice.

Wij als gezin wonen in Amsterdam met veel plezier en dankbaarheid. Wij heten je van harte welkom om deze prachtige een open minded plek te zien en ervaren.

Naast werk en hobby's: inspiratie, roeping, werk, carrière en zelfvertrouwen, genieten we als een gezin van het openstellen van onze deuren open voor gasten uit de hele wereld, om onze talen te oefenen en tips uit te wisselen.

In onze vrije tijd genieten we van hardlopen en wandelen en kijken we opgerold op de bank naar goede films genietend van elkaars gezelschap. We houden van lezen en voorlezen voor het slapen gaan, of lezen op een zondag-middag als de kinderen lekker in de kamer spelen.

We houden van het geluid van Chopin, maar ook verwesterde Indiase muziek zoals die van Deva Premal. We houden van yoga, stilte, meditatie. We genieten van uit eten gaan, biologisch voedsel, recept komt uit de oven, warme quiches, taarten, maar ook vis, veel vis en groenten. Maar het meest genieten we van grappen en de humor tussen ons.

Wij houden van reizen en willen nog heel veel landen en plaatsen zien en ervaren: een olifant trektocht in India, een jungle tour en duiken in Thailand, op een kameel door de Sahara en in een jeep van Zuid naar Noord-Afrika, maar we ook genieten van bezienswaardigheden en winkelen in San Fransico, Florence, Napels en Venetië.

Aan boord van de “Catharina van Mijdrecht” bent u in de handen van een vakkundige en ervaren bemanning. Met hun jarenlange ervaring weten zij elke zeiltocht tot een onvergetelijke ervaring te maken. Jos Rodewijk is de schipper die jullie veilig over de woelige baren voert. Danny Honig is de gastvrouw en zorgt er voor dat het jullie op culinair gebied aan niets ontbreekt. Bij gelegenheid wordt het team uitgebreid met ervaren freelancers, bijvoorbeeld voor uw trainingen.

Passie voor water
U bent in handen van een ervaren bemanningGeboren en getogen in het Zuid-Hollands plassengebied leerde ik als snel omgaan met het water. Op mijn twaalfde zeilde ik al zelfstandig. Toen ik later van deze passie voor water mijn beroep kon maken greep ik die kans met beide handen aan.
Op mijn schip draait het om de beleving van mijn gasten. Of ze nu een paar uurtjes of meerdere dagen aan boord zijn, mijn streven is om ze een belevenis mee te geven waar ze het nog lang over zullen hebben. Jong of oud, gepassioneerd zeiler of passieve genieter, iedereen voelt zich thuis op de Catharina van Mijdrecht.
Jos Rodewijk, schipper.

Passie voor lekker eten
Ervaren bemanningAls telg uit een bekend soepmakersgeslacht zat de passie voor  koken al in de genen. Met ouders die bovendien op de Holland-Amerika Lijn voeren combineer ik nu beide werelden door de catering te verzorgen aan boord van de Catharina van Mijdrecht. Het is altijd een weer een uitdaging om onder de soms lastige omstandigheden aan boord toch een lekkere maaltijd op tafel te zetten.

I'm Marleen, 37 years. I live with my husband and three children at the age of 2, 4 and 6 years in Amsterdam. Kasper (my husband) and I both work and therefore we love to go on trips ourselves when we have the time. Hiking, skiing and relaxing in a different environment. 

Last year we have traveled around Europe for three months. That was the first time we rented out our house. That time we used an agent. Now we rent our home directly which makes it more fun since you have direct contact with the tenants. Now we learn about why they wnat to visit Amsterdam and are happy to help them with tips for good restaurants, fun activities in and around the city. 

Our house is wonderfully light, spacious and fully equipped. Also an ideal place for children to play and a garden where you can enjoy a good glass of wine in the sun after a day of sight seeing Amsterdam.

I love traveling. Have in the past traveled extensively in Asia. Since the arrival of our children we do not travel with a backpack, but we often make a trip with our Volkswagen camper van. In addition, we regularly go to Spain or Italy for a week to feel the sun.
I also like to read a good book in the hammock in our lovely garden. Or I drink coffee or a glass of wine with friends on a terrace in the park or in the playground.
I work as a teacher. The students keep me young and free-thinking.

We live in a lovely neighbourhood on IJburg, close to the city, but also close to a beach, lake and big park. Amsterdam is not only open-minded and laid-back, but also has much to offer on a cultural and artistic area. We would like to give you the chance to discover this lovely city and relax back in our quiet house  & garden.

Welcome to Amsterdam!
Our property is in principle available every weekend, from saturday till Monday. It is also possible to rent the property during school holidays (check the calendar for the exact dates) which I try to keep up-to-date.

Over mezelf:
Ik hou van reizen. Heb in het verleden veel gereisd in Azië. Sinds de komst van onze kinderen reizen we niet meer met een rugzak, maar gaan we er vaak tussenuit met ons Volkswagen camperbusje. Daarnaast gaan we regelmatig een weekje naar Spanje of Italië om de zon te voelen.
Daarnaast lees ik graag een goed boek in de hangmat in onze heerlijke tuin. Of ik drink koffie of een goed glas wijn met vriendinnen op een terras, in het park of in de speeltuin.
Ik werk als docent. De leerlingen houden me jong en vrij denkend.

Wij wonen in een heerlijke, ruime woning op IJburg in Amsterdam. Amsterdam is niet alleen ruimdenkend en laid-back, maar heeft ook veel te bieden op cultureel en kunstzinnig gebied. Wij willen je graag de kans geven om vanuit ons relaxte huis deze heerlijke stad te ontdekken.
